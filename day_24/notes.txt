       -we can call Function multiple times for executing 

event:

Event bubbling
        -event propagation in the DOM 
        -event is peopagated from child to parent 

        DOM
        |
        Root Element
        |
        head body
         |
           div outside
           |
           div inside
           |
           button

 ex: button-->div(inside)-->div(outside)-->body-->html-->document   
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Event bubbling
    button-->div(inside)-->div(outside)

Event capturing:
     div(outside)-->div(inside)-->button
     -event is propagated from parent to child
     -default propagation is from child to parent
     -to achieve event capturing , we can use addEventListener()
      method with third argument as true
