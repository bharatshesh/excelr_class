what are callback function:
   --it is a function that is passed an sn argument to another function
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
callback hell(pyramid of doom)

 -it is a situation where we have multiple callback inside a callback(nested callback)
 -hard to read
 -hard to maintain/modify
 -this usually happens when we have to perform multiple asynchronous oprations

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
what are promises:
 -a promises in JS is an object that represent the outcome of an asynchronous oprations
 - it is used to handle the success and failure of an asynchronous oprations
 -states in promises
      1.pending-inital states2
      2.fulfilled-the oprations was successful
      3.rejeced-the oprations failed
 -we can use then() function to handle the success and failure of a promises
 -we can use catch() function to handle the failure of a Promises
 -we can use finally() function to handle the success and failure of promise     


async:
  -async function are functionn that return a promise
  async function are used to handle asynchronous oprations

  Syntax:
       async function functionName(){

       }

     awit:

      awit keywords is used to wait for a promise to resole
      awit is used inside an async function
      it will make the code asynchronous

      Syntax:

       async function functionName(){
        awit functionName();
       }  

 & awit keywords
Promises.all
